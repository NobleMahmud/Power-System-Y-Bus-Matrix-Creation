# Power-System-Y-Bus-Matrix-Creation
The purpose of this code is to create a Y-bus matrix for a power system based on user input. The Y-bus matrix represents the admittance or impedance values between different buses in the power system. The code allows the user to choose between impedance or admittance calculation.
